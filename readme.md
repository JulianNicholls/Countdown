# Countdown

This is a word finder for the UK (originally French) TV gameshow 
[Countdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_%28game_show%29).

## Word list

It uses a word list constructed from
Kevin Atkinson's [wordlist page](http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/). 
I have included the whole copyright file that comes with the download, since
all the component word lists have ultimately been placed in the public domain, 
but there are a number of different statements of copyright contained. Clearly,
I am deeply in Kevin's debt for the word list and acknowledge the sterling work
that he has done.

The wordlist that I have chosen to construct from his files is:

- Level 80, with...
- English and British up to variant 1.
- No abbreviations, proper names, Roman numerals, and hacker words. 
- Word lengths 5 to 9.

I'd say that the wordlist seems to be at about the right level, because 
when Susie Dent uses the pen camera on the dictionary, the word has been found by
this prpgram as one of the longest words.

## Bonuses

It only occurred to me while I was watching my first Countdown after I 
developed this, that it works just as well for:

- The teatime teasers at the end of each segment.
- The final conundrum round.

It will also work for anagrams, as long as the solution is one word of 
9 letters, at most.
